# Favorite Movie Series
My favorite movie series is the *Lord of the Rings* movie series because they were able to replicate the environment, worldbuilding, and storytelling of the original book series, while enhancing certain scenes and expectations from the book, although they did take some creative liberties and remove certain details from the book, probably because they couldn't fit in the entire book, and would probably last more than 3 movies or wasn't relevant to the current scene of the movie. The *Lord of the Rings* movie series were separated into three different movies:
1. *The Fellowship of the Ring*
2. *The Two Towers*
3. *The Return of the King*
These three movies were so popular that they spawned another movie series related to them detailing the past called the *The Hobbit*, which comprises of also three movies:
1. *An Unexpected Journey*
2. *The Desolation of Smaug*
3. *The Battle of the Five Armies*
With these movies I provided, I hope that everyone who reads this can share in the joy of watching these movies for the first time as I did.
